Hello! I am currently navigating through the second year of my graduate studies in [the Master's Programs in Informatics](https://informatics.tsukuba.ac.jp/en/), nestled within the Graduate School of Comprehensive Human Sciences at the [University of Tsukuba, Japan](https://www.tsukuba.ac.jp/). My academic quests are primarily anchored in the realms of Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval, under the nurturing guidance of [Professor Haitao Yu](https://ii-research-yu.github.io/), in the innovative environment of the [Information Intelligence Lab](https://ii-research.github.io/).

When it comes to research, my curiosity veers towards Emotion Analysis, Hierarchical Classification, and the broad expanse of Machine Learning. Every discovery and understanding in these fields not only fuels my academic voyage but also finds a mention on this page.

This platform serves as a repository of my learning and explorations. Through this page, I am keen on documenting and disseminating the knowledge I accrue over time, fostering a space of learning and collaborative intellectual growth.

Please feel free to share your opinions and make progress together.
