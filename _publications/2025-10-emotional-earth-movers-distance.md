Effective emotion understanding has become increasingly important in developing human-centered interactive systems, such as chatbots and companion/service robots. Despite the remarkable successes made by previous studies, we found that the hierarchical information among emotion labels has been ignored when either quantifying the optimization objective or evaluating the performance, hindering the achievement of fine-grained hierarchical emotion analysis.

To bridge this gap, we propose **Emotional Earth Mover's Distance (EEMD)**, a novel framework that extends the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) to emotion analysis by explicitly encoding the hierarchical structure of emotion labels. This hierarchical distance is integrated into both the training loss and evaluation metric, allowing EEMD to effectively capture the hierarchical emotion nuances throughout the entire cycle of emotion analysis.
